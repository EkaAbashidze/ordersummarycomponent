## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Most of all, I learned some new things, including how to place a background image without repeating itself;
I learned how to use flexbox better;
While coding, I informed myself more about positions;
One of the most important part was how to use parents and children, using div tags a lot;
How to place everything where necessary using position tag and flex, and measure each and every pixel to achieve the desired result;
While doing some mistakes, I even learned to correct some mistakes, even though I now see how I could code better
and will use this knowledge in my next projects.



### Continued development

I would love to master positions, flexbox, and choosing right tags for each component better in the future.

### Useful resources

Most helpful ones were my mentors, as well as Youtube, Google and css-tricks web-site.
